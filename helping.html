  <center><p>The Social Security Administration helps people receive benefits after they retire. Specifically,
     The Social Security disability insurance program pays benefits to you and certain family members if you
     worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. To qualify for Social Security disability benefits,
     you must first have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. Then you must have a medical condition
     that meets Social Security's definition of disability. In general, they pay monthly benefits to people
     who are unable to work for a year or more because of a disability.</p></center>
